# Hey there, I'm Mrigank ðŸ‘‹

I am a multi-disciplinary developer, designer and entrepreneur pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics at The Pennsylvania State University. As of today, I am co-founding and developing <a href="https://www.whisperingmule.com">Mule</a>, an intelligent delivery system application that enables peer to peer delivery in exchange for incentivized benefits. I have also co-founded and am the current President of <a href="https://www.blockchainpsu">Blockchain@PSU</a>, a student run organization that trains students and instill upon them the skills essential to FinTech. 

When not working with technology, I can be found geeking out on astrophysics, playing squash, or binge watching movies/shows. Psst, I enjoy sipping on bubble tea while playing Jenga. I'm also proud to support <a href="https://www.thon.org">THON</a>, the world's largest student run philanthropy.

Fun fact: I play seven musical instruments!
