# Hey there, I'm Mrigank ðŸ‘‹

I am a multi-disciplinary developer, designer and entrepreneur currently living in University Park, Pennsylvania. As of today I am co-founding and developing Mule, an intelligent delivery system application that enables peer to peer delivery in exchange for incentivized benefits. I have co-founded and am the current President of Blockchain@PSU, a student run organization that trains students and instill upon them the skills essential to FinTech. 

I am a rising senior at The Pennsylvania State University, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. Since 2018, I have been exploring the different applications of blockchain and engaging myself in a FinTech environment. I also love physics and I aspire to have a future that keeps me around it.

When not working with technology, I can be found geeking out on astrophysics, playing squash, or binge watching movies/shows. Psst, I enjoy sipping on bubble tea while playing Jenga. I'm also proud to support THON, the world's largest student run philanthropy.

Fun fact: I play seven musical instruments!
