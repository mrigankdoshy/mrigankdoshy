# Hey there, I'm Mrigank 👋

I'm a multi-disciplinary developer, designer, entrepreneur and a recent graduate with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics from The Pennsylvania State University. 

I'm a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.kcftech.com">KCF Technologies</a> where I work full-stack to build enterprise software that delivers sustainable and comprehensive machine health solutions. In the past, I've co-founded and developed <a href="https://www.themuleapp.com">Mule</a>, an intelligent system that enables peer to peer delivery in college towns while helping students have complete autonomy over their schedules. 

When not working with technology, I geek out on physics, game on the PS4, and binge watch movies/shows. I enjoy sipping on bubble tea while playing Jenga. I'm also proud to support <a href="https://www.thon.org">THON</a>, the world's largest student run philanthropy. 🎗️

Fun fact: I play seven musical instruments!

Many of my projects are private repositories. If you're interested in viewing my work, please feel free to reach out!
