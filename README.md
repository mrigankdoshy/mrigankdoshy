# Hey there, I'm Mrigank üëã 

I'm a software engineer, with a passion for developing (and occasionally designing) digital experiences. Currently, I'm focused on building sustainable and comprehensive machine health centered products at <a href="https://www.kcftech.com">KCF Technologies</a>. These days, I primarily work with [React](https://react.dev) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), crafting performant and intuitive web and mobile applications.

In the past, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey. One highlight I‚Äôm particularly proud of is co-founding and developing [Mule](https://www.themuleapp.com), an iOS and Android app using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). The app empowered peer-to-peer delivery in college towns, while giving students complete autonomy over their schedules (serving 100+ users).

Beyond technology, you‚Äôll often find me playing musical instruments, exploring the wonders of physics, gaming on the PlayStation, or binge-watching movies and shows :)

‚ö†Ô∏è Most of my projects are private repositories. If you're interested in viewing my work, please feel free to reach out!
